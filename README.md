# Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game Metagame Report
An up-to-date, cheat-sheet-like guide on the current metagame (state of what decks and cards are good) in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game.

Last Updated: September 2022

# Introduction

This report is intended to a one-stop-shop cheat sheet for the state of the metagame, with information regarding:
* Decks that are well-represented or "good"
* * How they work
* * How to beat them
* What cards are generically good
* * Hand Traps
* * Side Decking
* * Splashable Engines
* And other useful information. 

I originally wrote this privately for myself, but figured it might be a good public resource.

I intend to update this guide whenever the previous version becomes out-of-date or incomplete, for whatever reason - new banlist, new decks released or beginning to do well, great new cards released that affect the metagame, etc. Old versions will be stored in a folder called `old_reports`, which does not yet exist as we are currently on the present version. 

# What Decks are Good
## [Tearlaments](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments)
Tearlaments appear to be the best deck of the format. Hard to stop with their deluge of graveyard effects and Fusion summoning, they can be played pure or can be further aided by engines like Dangers, P.U.N.K., and others, including even Spright.

## [Spright](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright)
Spright seems to be playing second fiddle to Tearlament variants this format, but can by no means be ignored or discounted. Focusing on Level/Link/Rank 2 plays and easily synergizing with other Level/Link/Rank 2 engines like Frogs and Live Twins and having inherent protection from targeting (via Spright Elf) and even Nibiru (Gigantic Spright), their build-a-board/break-my-board strategy can be tough to handle.

# What Engines and Packages are Good

## [Adventure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Adventurer_Token_(series))

If a deck doesn't care too much about their Normal Summon's effect, the Adventure engine is versatile and powerful, giving you interactions and recusion.

The combo is as follows:
* 0. If you have Water Enchantress in hand and don't fear Droll & Lock Bird, activate [Water Enchantress of the Temple](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Water_Enchantress_of_the_Temple) to add Rite of Aramesir.
* 1. Activate [Rite of Aramesir](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rite_of_Aramesir), summoning an [Adventure Token](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Adventurer_Token) and activating [Fateful Adventure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fateful_Adventure) from Deck. This locks you from activating the effects of any non-Special Summoned monster the entire turn, retroactively.
* 2. Activate [Fateful Adventure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fateful_Adventure) to add [Wandering Gryphon Rider](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wandering_Gryphon_Rider) from your deck to your hand, then send 1 card from your hand to your GY. If you already have [Wandering Gryphon Rider](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wandering_Gryphon_Rider) in hand, you may add [Water Enchantress of the Temple](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Water_Enchantress_of_the_Temple) or [Illegal Knight](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Illegal_Knight).
* 3. Special Summon [Wandering Gryphon Rider](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wandering_Gryphon_Rider) by its own effect, triggering [Fateful Adventure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fateful_Adventure) to let you add [Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dracoback,_the_Rideable_Dragon) from Deck to hand.
* 4. Equip [Adventure Token](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Adventurer_Token) with [Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dracoback,_the_Rideable_Dragon).

Fully realized, it leaves you with:
* [Fateful Adventure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fateful_Adventure) face-up, which lets you add a monster that mentions Adventure Token every your turn, at the price of sending a card from hand to GY afterwards;
* [Adventure Token](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Adventurer_Token) that will survive its first possible destruction by battle, courtesy of Fateful Adventure
* * Adventure Token will be Equipped with [Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dracoback,_the_Rideable_Dragon), which allows you to target and bounce any card your opponent controls on your turn, while being able to re-equip itself to Adventure Token if send to GY once per turn
* [Wandering Gryphon Rider](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wandering_Gryphon_Rider), a level 8 WIND Winged Beast with 2000/2800 that, when you control Adventure Token, can Quick Effect omni negate and destroy by shuffling itself into the Deck - allowing it to be recycled with Fateful Adventure
* [Illegal Knight](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Illegal_Knight) is run by some, which Quick Effect Special Summons itself when you control no monsters or an Adventure Token and can Quick Effect target 1 or 2 cards the opponent controls, give control of itself to the opponent, and return the targeted cards to hand. It's a decent card going second or even first, but isn't as necessary as other parts.

In summary, you get a self-sustaining package that includes a free bounce and an omni negate. Many decks can also use the Adventure Token and/or Wandering Gryphon Rider as Link or Synchro Material as well.

Stop this package by stopping [Rite of Aramesir](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rite_of_Aramesir) if you can, though it's difficult going second, as it does not add from deck to hand, doding Ash Blossom. Alternatively, stop [Water Enchantress of the Temple](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Water_Enchantress_of_the_Temple) if they play that first, otherwise stop Fateful Adventure itself when it attempts to add.

**Engine Skeleton:**
* 2-3 Rite of Aramesir
* 2-3 Water Enchantress of the Temple
* 1-2 Fateful Adventure
* 1 Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon
* 1 Wandering Gryphon Rider

*Whole engine is about $150 with 3 Rite/3 Water Enchantress/2 Fateful Adventure. If you cut 1 of each of these and accept the consistency loss (and also a 2nd Fateful Adventure isn't really necessary), it's about $100.*

## [P.U.N.K.](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/P.U.N.K.)

This versatile engine starts with [Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Ze_Amin), either Normal Summoning it (possibly having been added to hand via [Noh-P.U.N.K. Ogre Dance](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Ogre_Dance) or Special Summoning it (via [Emergency Teleport](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Emergency_Teleport)) and using its effect to add [Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Foxy_Tune).

Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune then sends itself from hand to GY as cost, and on resolution sends another card from hand to GY and Special Summons a P.U.N.K. from deck, generally [Noh-P.U.N.K. Deer Note](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Deer_Note), which when sent from the field to GY, can target then Special Summon a non-Level 5 P.U.N.K. from GY.

At this point, the functionality of the P.U.N.K. engine diverges with the strategy of the deck it's in - level 8 Synchros, link-2 Links, maybe more. Some common strategies:
* Make [Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Chaos_Ruler,_the_Chaotic_Magical_Dragon), so that the deck in question can excavate their deck's top 5 cards for a monster to add to hand and get potential benefits from sending the other excavated cards to the GY, and potentially use Chaos Ruler itself as synchro/link material both after initial summon and after its self-summon from GY. 
* Make [Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K._Amazing_Dragon) for its level 3 Psychic add from deck (useful in Virtual World to add Lulu). In addition, if Ze Amin is sent to GY and a P.U.N.K. is on the field when his effect activates, he can target that P.U.N.K. and boost its ATK, allowing him to further Chain Block along with Deer Note.
* Make [Crystron Halqifibrax](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Crystron_Halqifibrax) for any variety of combos using that card, either immediately with Ze Amin + Deer Note or with a Deer Note-summoned Ze Amin + what you make beforehand with Ze Amin + Deer Note.
* And who knows how many more.

Stop this package by stopping Ze Amin or Foxy Tune. Hitting Ze Amin may possibly waste your interaction, as your opponent may have drawn Foxy Tune. Hitting Foxy Tune will almost always work. Don't hit Emergency Teleport, as you can just hit Ze Amin or Foxy Tune later, and your opponent may have also drawn a Ze Amin/Ogre Dance.

**Engine Skeleton:**
* 1-3 [Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Ze_Amin)
* 0-3 [Noh-P.U.N.K. Ogre Dance](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Ogre_Dance)
* 1-2 [Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Foxy_Tune) (is potentially a Garnet)
* 1-2 [Noh-P.U.N.K. Deer Note](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Deer_Note) (is a Garnet)
* 3 [Emergency Teleport](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Emergency_Teleport)
* Relevant Extra Deck monsters according to the deck/strategy

*Whole engine is about $65 with 2 Deer Note 2 Foxy Tune. Cutting one of one or both saves deck space but increases the risk of drawing a 1-of Garnet. Cutting one of each will save you about $27 for a new total of $38.*

## [Danger](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!)

On and off the Forbidden & Limited List, these monsters that cause random discards and then either gain effects of being discarded or summon themselves and draw a card when not discarded are used in a variety of decks to put bodies on the field, get cards from the hand to GY, and dig deeper into the deck.

**Engine Skeleton:**
* 3 [Danger! Nessie!](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!_Nessie!)
* * If discarded, it adds a Danger! card from deck to hand, letting you continue to dig through your deck/put bodies on the field while also thinning out the deck.
* 1 [Danger!? Jackalope?](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!%3F_Jackalope%3F)
* * If discarded, it summons another Danger from deck, ensuring you get a body on the field.
* 1 [Danger!? Tsuchinoko?](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!%3F_Tsuchinoko%3F)
* * If discarded, it summons itself, ensuring you get a body on the field.
* 0-3 [Danger! Bigfoot!](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!_Bigfoot!)
* * If discarded, can destroy an opponent's face-up card, helping keep abreast in card advantage and giving the engine a going-second functionality. 
* 0-3 [Danger! Mothman!](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!_Mothman!)
* * If discarded, each player draws 1 card and discards 1 card, ensuring you keep digging through your deck and letting you get a card from hand to GY, possibly triggering GY effects/other Dangers. Can also mess up your opponent's hand, or fix it/give them the same GY effects benefits, so beware. 
* 0-3 [Danger! Thunderbird!](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!_Thunderbird!)
* * If discarded, can destroy an opponent's Set card, helping keep abreast in card advantage and giving the engine a going-second functionality. 

*The minimum package of 3 Nessie/1 Jackalope/1 Tsuchinoko will run you about $45, with ~$20 of that being Tsuchinoko. Expensive, but worth it. Mothman is $6 each, adding $18 to $45 for $63. Bigfoot is preferable to Thunderbird right now and is $6 each. Thunderbird is $2.50 each. Getting 3 Nessie/1 Jackalope/1 Tsuchinoko/3 Bigfoot/3 Mothman/3 Thunderbird totals to $90, but you'll have every mix of the best Dangers for the future.*

## Artifact

More of a package than an engine, a deck may make the incredibly generic [Artifact Dagda](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Artifact_Dagda) and trigger it to set [Artifact Scythe](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Artifact_Scythe). On the opponent's turn, some method is used to destroy the Set Artifact Scythe and special summon it to lock the opponent out of their Extra Deck, such as [Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Destiny_HERO_-_Destroyer_Phoenix_Enforcer) or [T.G. Wonder Magician](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/T.G._Wonder_Magician)'s on-Synchro Summon effect using Crystron Halqifibrax to summon it. Most often now that Verte Anaconda is banned, it's Crystron Halqifibrax summoning T.G. Wonder Magician to do this, then using T.G. Wonder Magician's Synchro Summoning effect to tune with Artifact Scythe to make [Baronne de Fleur](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Baronne_de_Fleur), an incredibly powerful level 10 3k ATK Synchro with an omni negate and destroy, a free target and destroy on controller's turn, and a free Standby Phase Special Summon of a level 9 or lower monster from GY at the cost of returning itself to the Extra Deck from the field.

Note: Many players suspect Artifact Scythe is due for a ban soon.

When you have a method to reliably destroy the set Artifact Scythe, its an extremely generic and powerful package that requires just 1 Extra Deck slot and 1 Main Deck slot.

**Package Skeleton:**
* 1 [Artifact Dagda](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Artifact_Dagda)
* 1 [Artifact Scythe](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Artifact_Scythe)

*Scythe is available as a common for pennies and Dagda is $7.*
