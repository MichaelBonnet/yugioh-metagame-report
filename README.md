# Introduction

This report is intended to a one-stop-shop cheat sheet for the state of the metagame, with information regarding:
* Decks that are well-represented or "good"
* * How they work
* * How to beat them
* What cards are generically good
* * Hand Traps
* * Side Decking
* * Splashable Engines
* And other useful information. 

I originally wrote this privately for myself, but figured it might be a good public resource.

I intend to update this guide whenever the previous version becomes out-of-date or incomplete, for whatever reason - new banlist, new decks released or beginning to do well, great new cards released that affect the metagame, etc. Old versions will be stored in a folder called `old_reports`, which does not yet exist as we are currently on the present version. 

# What Decks are Good
## [Tearlaments](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments)
Tearlaments appear to be the best deck of the format. Hard to stop with their deluge of graveyard effects and Fusion summoning, they can be played pure or can be further aided by engines like Dangers, P.U.N.K., and others, including even Spright.
### Tearlaments: How the Deck Works & Win Condition(s)
While Tearlaments are ostensibly a Fusion deck, that's not really how the deck achieves win conditions. Tearlaments are best described as a Fusion Summon- and milling-driven strategy to build varied endboards out of those Fusions and other cards that is able to play though multiple interruptions. When I say "multiple interruptions", I mean I have seen Tearlaments play through PSY-Framegear Gamma and Nibiru on the same turn without breaking a sweat. Tearlaments are often (though not always) played with accompanying engines, such as [P.U.N.K.](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/P.U.N.K.), [Danger](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!), and more to get more materials and/or access power cards like [Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Curious,_the_Lightsworn_Dominion) and [Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Chaos_Ruler,_the_Chaotic_Magical_Dragon), which Tearlaments greatly benefit from as they are DARK and gain effects off being sent to GY by card effects. 

The main deck Tearlaments monsters all have a HOPT effect when sent to GY by card effects, and another HOPT effect that can be activated. Save for [Tearlaments Reinoheart](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Reinoheart), a WATER Warrior, they are all DARK Aqua monsters that, hard once per turn, when sent to the GY by card effects, allow you to Fusion Summon by placing the card sent and other materials on the bottom of the Deck. This means you'll generally get about three total Fusion Summons on your turn, as there are three non-Reinohart main deck Tearlaments monsters. Reinohart's effect when sent to GY is to Special Summon itself, followed by sending a Tearlaments card from hand to GY (potentially triggering other GY effects.)

[Tearlaments Scheiren](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Scheiren)'s other effect allows you to Special Summon it from hand, followed by sending a monster from hand to GY and milling 3. Both Scheiren and Reinoheart are level 4, opening the door to Rank 4 plays. 

[Tearlaments Havnis](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Havnis)'s other effect allows you to Quick Effect Special Summon it from hand when your opponent activates a monster effect on the field, followed by milling 3. This gives the deck an in-archetype "hand trap" of sorts, and can on its own lead to Fusion plays.

[Tearlaments Merrli](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Merrli)'s other effect lets you mill 3 on its Normal or Special Summon. Being level 2 lets it start to form synergy with Spright Elf and the wider Spright engine.

[Primeval Planet Perlereino](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Primeval_Planet_Perlereino) is the Field Spell for this deck, allowing a Tearlaments monster or Visas Starfrost add from Deck to hand on activation, granting +500 ATK to Tearlaments and Fusions, and a target-and-destroy 1 card on the field when a Tearlaments monster controlled or in owner's GY is shuffled back to Deck. This card is both a big consistency boost and a source of removal that can be used both on your turn and on your opponent's - say, when a Tearlaments Fusion Summoning effect is triggered off being milled by Havnis. The 500 ATK boost seems small but can help you get over problem cards, like say Gigantic Spright. 

[Tearlaments Kitkallos](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Kitkallos) is the main Fusion engine piece of the deck, letting you add or send to GY a Tearlaments card from deck and then pop a Tearlaments monster to Special Summon another from hand or GY. If it is itself sent to GY by card effect (such as by its own effect), you mill a whopping 5 cards. 

[Tearlaments Sulliek](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Sulliek) is a Continuous Trap that in addition to its on-field negation effect, lets you add a Tearlaments monster from deck to GY. Sulliek's effects effects are HOPT and but can both be used in a turn.

[Tearlaments Metanoise](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Metanoise) is a Normal Trap that in addition to its on-field Book of Moon + Foolish of a Tearlaments monster, recovers a Tearlaments monster from GY to hand when sent to GY. Metanoise's effects are HOPT and only one can be used per turn, not both.

[Tearlaments Cryme](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments_Cryme) is a Counter Trap that is a Spell/Trap activation or monster effect negate and shuffle that requires a Tearlaments monster or Visas Starfrost on field to activate, and sends a monster from hand to GY on resolution. The send from hand can trigger Tearlaments fusion summoning effects, but requires a bit of hand management/setup. If sent to GY by a card effect, it recovers a banished Tearlaments monster to hand. Cryme's effects are HOPT and only one can be used per turn, not both.

With these cards and other easy-to-summon Fusions (like Mudragon of the Swamp, Garura the Wings of Resonant Life, etc), it's a powerhouse of turboing out materials for endboard pieces.

The win condition of the deck varies slightly from variant to variant and strategy to strategy, but is generally "establish a board of interruptions and floodgates, then recover as needed through milling and recycling resources."

### Tearlaments: Variants
Before we get into this, I want to make a note about the non-pure variants. Like in many decks nowadays, the additional engines not only directly advance the main win condition, but also themselves put the opponent into a tough bind. The opponent generally has a limited number of interactions on hand and so can either stop those engines that enable the deck so much, OR they can save their interactions for the main plays of the deck (in this case, the Tearlaments themselves) - rarely both. And in some cases, the extra engines can serve simply as bait for interactions, whether or not the engines would have completed their lines of play, and allow the rest of the deck to function uninterrupted. 

**Pure:** Rather than rely on other engines for extra power, Pure Tearlaments instead rely on the inherent resistance of the deck to interaction to build small, sturdy endboards enhanced the hand traps and other cards ran in deck space that would otherwise have been spent on engines. With the Extra Deck space, Pure Tearlaments can focus on Xyz plays with cards like [Abyss Dweller](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Abyss_Dweller) and [Time Thief Redoer](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Time_Thief_Redoer), with [Bahamut Shark](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Bahamut_Shark) bringing out the feared [Toadally Awesome](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Toadally_Awesome). Xyz plays open up access to [Divine Arsenal AA-ZEUS - Sky Thunder](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Divine_Arsenal_AA-ZEUS_-_Sky_Thunder), an amazing board-breaking and game-simplifying engine of destruction. Spright Elf protects the board, while other links like the [Dharc](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dharc_the_Dark_Charmer,_Gloomy) and [Eria](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Eria_the_Water_Charmer,_Gentle) Charmers gain resources for the user and deny them to the opponent. 
* Examples: [Cristian Urena's 3rd Place YCS Niagara Falls build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Tearlaments/462520), [Dino Spasovski's Oceania WCQ 2022 Champion build](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxTCINTRM1o)

**[Danger](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!):** The Danger package, just as it's been used in the past, is used to dig into the deck for the pieces needed for combos (increasing consistency) and put bodies on the board for Link and Synchro plays. One of the big Link plays takes advantage of the varied Types of the DARK-attribute Dangers to bring out [Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Curious,_the_Lightsworn_Dominion) to Foolish Burial any card and further mill. Danger! Nessie! is also Aqua, which can aid in making Tearlaments Kitkallos. Beyond that, Dangers can aid in making othe endboard pieces when other methods fail, such as tuning Nessie with a Veiler'd/Imperm'd Ze Amin to make Baronne de Fleur. 
* Examples: [Robert Klonowski's YCS Niagara Top 32 build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Spright-P-U-N-K-Tearlaments/462555), [Jensen Kellett's Indianapolis Regional Top 8 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Tearlaments/462275), [Sanjay Jayram's Oceania WCQ Top 16 Build featuring Visas Starfrost](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Starfrost-Danger-Tearlaments/462260), [Henry Bancroft's Euro WCQ 2022 Top 16 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Tearlaments/461748), [Luke Parkes' YCS Niagara Falls Top 8 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Tearlaments/462522) featuring [Branded in High Spirits](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Tearlaments/462559) and [D.3.S. Frog](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/D.3.S._Frog)
* Examples with teched 1 Spright Jet + 1 Spright Smashers: [Bohdan Temnyk's Oceania WCQ 2022 2nd Place Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Tearlaments/462249), [Jesse Kotton's YCS Niagara Falls 2nd Place Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Tearlaments/462519). These two cards give a free DARK level 2 body and an interaction via Jet + Smashers.

**[P.U.N.K.](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/P.U.N.K.):** The P.U.N.K. engine, when uninterrupted, generally serves to bring out [Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Chaos_Ruler,_the_Chaotic_Magical_Dragon) with Ze Amin + Deer Note, chain block the Chaos Ruler with cl1 Chaos Ruler cl2 Deer Note target Ze Amin, get an add and 4-5 mills (aka, Tearlaments fusion summon effects triggers) off Chaos Ruler, then make Crystron Halqifibrax with Ze Amin + Chaos Ruler. Halq summons [Shinobi Necro](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Shinobi_Necro), a DARK level 2 Zombie tuner which can be used for other linking (such as for Curious or Spright Elf) before being banished from GY along with a LIGHT (generally Foxy Tune) to Special Summon Chaos Ruler by its own effect. Shinobi Necro then summons itself from banished, and Shinobi Necro + Chaos Ruler makes Baronne de Fleur. While Deer Note and Foxy Tune are Garnets of a sort regarding the general Chaos Ruler -> Halqifibrax -> Baronne de Fleur line  (you'd rather add Foxy Tune off Ze Amin then use Foxy Tune to get Deer Note), Deer Note can reveal itself and Foxy Tune to summon either, letting the play continue. This engine usually is played in combination with Dangers.
* Examples: [Isaac Lim's Oceania WCQ 2022 Top 8 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/P-U-N-K-Tearlaments/462253)

**[Danger](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!) [P.U.N.K.](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/P.U.N.K.):** This variant combines the previous two to reap the benefit of both, often in the form of easily summoning Curious and alternative routes to Chaos Ruler/Baronne de Fleur/Crystron Halqifibrax.
* Examples: [Joseph Gold's Louisville KY Regional Top 8 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Tearlaments/461760) featuring a Swap Frog engine, [Jordan Gallacher's YCS Niagara Falls Top 16 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Tearlaments/462559) featuring [Branded in High Spirits](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Tearlaments/462559) and [D.3.S. Frog](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/D.3.S._Frog)

**[Spright](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright):** Yes indeed, the second fiddle deck of the format also finds its way into the best one as an engine. Generally playing 1-3 [Spright Blue](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Blue), 1 [Spright Red](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Red), 1 [Spright Jet](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Jet), 0-1 [Spright Smashers](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Smashers), and 0-1 [Spright Starter](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Starter) in the main deck and 1-2 each of [Spright Elf](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Elf) and [Gigantic Spright](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gigantic_Spright), the Spright engine in Tearlaments uses these Level/Link/Rank 2 monsters to aid in things like summoning Curious (as Blue and Jet are DARK), countering opponent interactions with Red's monster negate, and making the endboard stronger with Spright Elf's targeting protection granted to those monsters it points to. Gigantic Spright's summon from deck protects you from Nibiru, but beware - it locks both your opponent AND you from summoning non level/Link/Rank 2s. Gigantic Spright can get you a free level 2 from deck (such as Merrli, letting you mill), and Spright Elf's Special Summon can both trigger Merrli and get you further engine or endboard pieces, like a resurrected Spright Red. Some Tearlments Spright decks also run 3 [Swap Frog](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Swap_Frog) and 1 [Ronintoadin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ronintoadin) to bring out [Toadally Awesome](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Toadally_Awesome), an amazingly-named potent omni-negate. Gigantic Spright can get Swap Frog from the deck, letting Swap send Ronintoadin from deck to GY. Get Swap Frog to the GY and Spright Elf (possibly made using Swap Frog and Gigantic Spright) summons Swap Frog back. Swap Frog sends a copy of itself from deck to GY, Ronintoadin summons itself, and Swap Frog + Ronintoadin makes Toadally Awesome, under targeting protection from Spright Elf. Oh, and Spright Elf can then summon back a Toadally Awesome that sent itself to GY for a negate, for yet another negate.

**[Danger](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!) [P.U.N.K.](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/P.U.N.K.) [Spright](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright):** This variant essentially combines all the previously mentioned engines into one potent mix of cards that lets the player piloting it pursue many different lines of play on the way to victory and play though many interactions. This is the most popular version of the deck today.
* Examples: [Dominic Couch's YCS Niagara Falls Top 4 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Spright-P-U-N-K-Tearlaments/462521), [Pak Pamornsut's YCS Niagara Top 8 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-P-U-N-K-Spright-Tearlaments/462523), [Michael Albanese's YCS Niagara Falls Top 32 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-P-U-N-K-Spright-Tearlaments/462556)

**[Danger](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!) [Spright](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright):** This variant omits the P.U.N.K. engine and uses the resulting space on more Extra Deck options and thicker Spright engines.
* Examples: [Trif's YCS Rio Top 8 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Spright-Danger-Tearlament/461998) featuring the Adventure engine, [Denis Nadas' YCS Niagara Falls Top 32 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Danger-Spright-Tearlaments/462557)

**[Branded](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Branded):** This deckspace-hungry variant uses Despia/Albaz/Branded cards to load monsters into the GY and trigger their effects while also summoning endboard pieces like [Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mirrorjade_the_Iceblade_Dragon) and getting the Mirrorjade/Lubellion/Branded in Red/Branded Opening resource loop going to both sustain your board and help recover from a broken one. The variant generally runs 1-2 [Fallen of Albaz](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fallen_of_Albaz), 0-3 [Aluber the Jester of Despia](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Aluber_the_Jester_of_Despia), 0-3 [Despian Tragedy](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Despian_Tragedy), 0-1 [Ad Libitum of Despia](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ad_Libitum_of_Despia), 3 [Branded Fusion](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Branded_Fusion), 3 [Branded Opening](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Branded_Opening), and 0-2 [Branded in Red](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Branded_in_Red) in the main deck and 0-2 [Albion the Branded Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Albion_the_Branded_Dragon), 0-1 [Alba-Lenatus the Abyss Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Alba-Lenatus_the_Abyss_Dragon), 1 [Lubellion the Searing Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lubellion_the_Searing_Dragon), 1 [Mirrorjade the Iceblade Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mirrorjade_the_Iceblade_Dragon), 0-2 [Masquerade the Iceblade Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Masquerade_the_Blazing_Dragon), 0-1 [Despian Quaeritis](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Despian_Quaeritis), and 0-1 [Despian Proskenion](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Despian_Proskenion) in the extra deck. 
* Examples: [Alyse Davis' Minneapolis Regional Top 8 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Branded-Tearlaments/461765), [Keegan Smith's Remote Duel Regional Top 8 Build](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Branded-Tearlaments/461770), [Chris Lofton's](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Branded-Tearlaments/461763) and [Gage McNeilly's](https://infinite.tcgplayer.com/yugioh/deck/Branded-Tearlaments/461764) Louisville Top 8 Builds

### Tearlaments: Key Supporting Cards and Tech Cards
Apart from aforementioned engines and the main cards of the deck, other cards enable the enable the deck to function, what I call "key supporting cards". Tech cards are nonstandard cards that do the same thing.

**Key Supporting Cards**
* [Knightmare Gryphon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Knightmare_Gryphon) follows up a Curious that has sent [https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Eradicator_Epidemic_Virus], Setting it to the field for use next turn - usually to call Spells, as power Spells like [Lightning Storm](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Lightning_Storm) and [Dark Ruler No More](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dark_Ruler_No_More)can break boards. Even if not used to set an Eradicator Epidemic Virus, Knightmare Gryphon's floodgate effect alone can severely hinder the opponent.
* [Spright Elf](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Elf) can be used completely independently of the main Spright engine as a board protector and Merrli-triggerer, while also able to disrupt an opponent's plays if timed properly.
* [Garura, Wings of Resonant Life](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Garura,_Wings_of_Resonant_Life) is one of the main Fusion targets, easily brought out with a pair of DARK Aqua Tearlaments. It is often summoned after having used Kitkallos using Kitkallos as material, so that Kitkallos can be used again later. When sent to GY, you get a bonus draw. Being DARK, it also helps in summoning Curious.
* [Mudragon of the Swamp](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Mudragon_of_the_Swamp) is another main Fusion target, relatively easy to summon as most of the deck is DARK but with varied Types when using other engines. It's protection effect is nice, but most often you're using Mudragon as a Link Material having changed to DARK for Curious or as Xyz Material with Scheiren or Reinohart for Abyss Dweller.
* [Predaplant Dragostapelia](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Predaplant_Dragostapelia) serves as both a fairly generic Fusion target with Tearlaments effects, and as a prime target for [Super Polymerization](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Super_Polymerization), which the deck often runs. It is in and of itself a decent endboard piece.
* [Curious, the Lightsworn Dominion](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Curious,_the_Lightsworn_Dominion) is a main focus of many variants. Upon summon, it can send any one card from deck to GY, like [Beatrice](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Beatrice,_Lady_of_the_Eternal). When a card is sent to GY (such as by its own first effect), it mills 3, fitting in nicely with the wider Tearlaments strategy. This can be used to send a missing piece to GY for further plays, send a generic extender like Fairy Tail - Snow or Gizmek Orochi for extending plays, or if used as Link Material for Knightmare Gryphon, send a power card like Eradicator Epidemic Virus or [Appointer of the Red Lotus](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Appointer_of_the_Red_Lotus).
* [Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Chaos_Ruler,_the_Chaotic_Magical_Dragon) is not only one of the best cards in the deck, but one of the best cards in the game. Most of your main engine (and even some of your auxiliary engine) pieces are DARK, getting you a free add, and the 4-5 mills can reap huge benefits if they hit the right cards. Furthermore, its self-summon allows it to be used for things like Baronne de Fleur, Crystron Halqifibrax, and Curious.
* [Super Polymerization](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Super_Polymerization) is often used in Tearlaments as both a board breaker and a mirror match enabler, as it can use the opponent's materials for your own Kitkallos.
* [Instant Fusion](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Instant_Fusion) is an immediate free Kitkallos whose effects you can use freely at the cost of 1000 LP. It just may be the best single card in the deck.

**Tech Cards**
* [Supreme Sea Mare](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Supreme_Sea_Mare) is a decent Normal Summon in Pure Tearlaments, acting as an Armageddon Knight of sorts for Aquas. Being level 4, it can be used for Rank 4 plays, or if left on the field in the End Phase, grant an add of an Aqua from GY to hand for use next turn, such as Havnis.
* [Fairy Tail - Snow](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fairy_Tail_-_Snow), [Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gizmek_Orochi,_the_Serpentron_Sky_Slasher), [Destrudo the Lost Dragon's Frisson](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Destrudo_the_Lost_Dragon%27s_Frisson), and [Blackwing - Zephyros the Elite](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Blackwing_-_Zephyros_the_Elite) are all fantastic extenders that can be used from the GY (and some even from hand), having been sent there by Curious or mill effects. Snow and Gizmek Orochi are also interactions on their own, giving the deck greater resiliency and routes to victory. Usually, at least Snow is ran, given its non-OPT use. 
* [Paleozoic Dinomischus](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Paleozoic_Dinomischus) was seen throughout the last few years in another Fusion strategy that benefits from being sent to GY by card effects - [Shaddolls](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Shaddoll). Now, it can be used for the same purpose - spot banishing removal with the benefit of triggering GY effects, then a body later.

### Tearlaments: Weaknesses and How to Beat It
Tearlaments rely heavily on the GY. Shutting down the GY ruins them and interfering with it hinders them. That was their downfall in the YCS Niagara Falls finals, as [Exosister](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Exosister) inherently is anti-GY and also packed Dimension Shifter. Abyss Dweller on its own can prematurely end turns, and D.D. Crow shuts down Fusion Summoning when it hits the Tearlaments monster that is attempting to Fusion Summon, as they must use themselves as material.

A key chokepoint is Tearlaments Kitkallos, though both effects are extremely good. If you can hit both through something like Effect Veiler or Infinite Impermanence, you'll be in decent shape. Other chokepoints tend to be highly dependent upon the variant/accompanying engines you're facing. For example, hitting [Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Ze_Amin)/[Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Foxy_Tune) makes it difficult to get off Chaos Ruler/Curious plays, while hitting Curious itself is dependent on if you fear what might be sent to GY, such as Eradicator Epidemic Virus followed up with Knightmare Gryphon.

Tearlaments play though interactions fairly easily, though. It took two Veilers, one Impermanence, a Nibiru, and a Ghost Mourner to stop Cristian Urena's Danger P.U.N.K. Tearlament in [the 3rd place match at YCS Niagara](https://yugiohblog.konami.com/2022/09/the-3rd-place-playoff-cristian-urena-versus-dominic-couch/). They're aided in this by the sheer number of bodies they can put on board, including self-summons like [Gizmek Orochi, the Serpentron Sky Slasher](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gizmek_Orochi,_the_Serpentron_Sky_Slasher) and [Fairy Tail - Snow](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fairy_Tail_-_Snow). The individual Tearlaments themselves aren't all that great to hit with negates, as for the most part they do what each other do (mill, send cards from hand to grave) and will get to their end goal either way.

I am personally of the opinion that blowout cards like [Forbidden Droplet](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Forbidden_Droplet) and [Dark Ruler No More](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dark_Ruler_No_More) and floodgates like Abyss Dweller are the move here, to break and prevent boards, respectively. [Super Polymerization](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Super_Polymerization) is also great, though your ability to use it is highly dependent upon your own deck.

## [Spright](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright)
Spright seems to be playing second fiddle to Tearlament variants this format, but can by no means be ignored or discounted. Focusing on Level/Link/Rank 2 plays and easily synergizing with other Level/Link/Rank 2 engines like Frogs and Live Twins and having inherent protection from targeting (via Spright Elf) and even Nibiru (Gigantic Spright), their build-a-board/break-my-board strategy can be tough to handle.
### Spright: How the Deck Works & Win Condition(s)
Spright uses its main deck monsters, all of whom can Special Summon themselves from the hand when the user controls a Level 2 monster, to synergize with other Level 2 engines like Frogs, Runick, Live★Twin, and others to build smaller but resilient boards focused on Level/Link/Rank 2 monsters.

[Spright Blue](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Blue) has the same Special Summon from hand effect that all main deck Sprights do, and on its own Special Summon (by any means) can add a Spright monster from deck to hand. This is the main monster engine piece, complimented by the spell Spright Starter. In most cases, you'll be adding Spright Jet off Blue. 

[Spright Jet](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Jet) has the same Special Summon from hand effect that all main deck Sprights do, and on its own Special Summon (by any means) can add a Spright spell or trap from deck to hand. 

[Spright Red](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Red) has the same Special Summon from hand effect that all main deck Sprights do, and has a Quick effect (regardless of how it got on the field) to tribute another Level/Rank/Link 2 monster to negate a monster effect, then if the Tribute was Rank/Link 2, it destroys that monster too. Spright Red serves as an in-archetype both counter to hand traps like Nibiru/Gamma/Fusion effects of Tearlaments milled off Havnis/etc and an endboard piece.

[Spright Carrot](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Carrot) has the same Special Summon from hand effect that all main deck Sprights do, and has a Quick effect (regardless of how it got on the field) to tribute another Level/Rank/Link 2 monster to negate a Spell/Trap card activation or effect, then if the Tribute was Rank/Link 2, it destroys that Spell/Trap too. It serves the same role as Red but against Spells/Traps, so things like Impermanence or opposing engine spells like Primeval Planet Perlereino.

[Spright Pixies](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Pixies) has the same Special Summon from hand effect that all main deck Sprights do, while also being an [Honest](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Honest) for Level/Rank/Link 2 monsters that are battling.

[Spright Starter](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Starter) Special Summons a Spright monster from deck at the cost of its ATK value as LP damage and locking you into only being able to Special Summon Level/Rank/Link 2 monsters for the rest of the turn. This card is also HOPT.

[Spright Smashers](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Smashers) banishes a Springans, Therion, or Spright card from hand or GY for cost (usually Spright in this deck) to do any 1 of the following: 1) Special Summon a Springans monster from Deck, 2) Special Summon a Therion monster from GY, or 3) Banish 1 Level/Rank/Link 2 monster controlled and 1 card the opponent controls. Usually, this deck is using that third effect as searchable spot removal/disruption. This card is also HOPT.

[Spright Elf](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright_Elf) requires 2 monsters including a Level/Rank/Link 2 monster as material, and cannot be used as Link Material the turn it's Link Summoned. It protects monsters it points to (each bottom corner) from being targeted with card effects, and Quick Effect can target and Special Summon a Level 2 monster in GY, or can instead target a Link/Rank 2 if the opponent controls a monster. This card is a huge combo enabler, a board protector that forces the opponent to waste an interaction on Spright Elf to get at the rest of the board, and a source of recursion. It's the most important single card in the deck in my opinion and is good enough to be ran in other decks.

[Gigantic Spright](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Gigantic_Spright) is a Rank 2 Xyz that requires 2 Level and/or Link 2 monsters as material. During controller's Main Phase, it can, on resolution, detach 1 material from a monster controlled (that is, any Xyz with materials controlled), to Special Summon a level 2 monster from Deck and lock both players out from Special Summoning non Level/Rank/Link 2 monsters for the rest of the turn - preventing the opponent from Nibiru-ing. It compliments Spright Elf by letting the deck cheat out any Level 2, in-archetype or out, then Spright Elf can reuse it.

The Frog Package is played in almost every Spright deck for its natural Level 2 synergy and the ability to easily cheat out the amazing endboard piece [Toadally Awesome](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Toadally_Awesome). Generally consisting of 3 copies of [Swap Frog](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Swap_Frog) and a single copy of [Ronintoadin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ronintoadin), you can either Normal Summon Swap Frog as the root Level 2 for Spright special summons, or bring it out the combo way. The combo way is to make Gigantic Spright and use its effect to summon Swap Frog, which then sends Ronintoadin from Deck to GY. Swap Frog + Gigantic Spright makes Spright Elf, who then summons Swap Frog from GY, and Swap Frog sends a copy of itself from Deck to GY. Ronintoadin banishes the Swap Frog in GY to summon itself, and Swap Frog + Ronintoadin makes Toadally Awesome in a zone protected by Spright Elf. The opponent then has to handle Spright Elf before Toadally Awesome, or else Spright Elf can Summon back a Toadally Awesome that sent itself for a negate so it can be used a second time, as none of Toadally Awesome's effects are hard once per turn.

# What Engines and Packages are Good

## [Adventure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Adventurer_Token_(series))

If a deck doesn't care too much about their Normal Summon's effect, the Adventure engine is versatile and powerful, giving you interactions and recusion.

The combo is as follows:
* 0. If you have Water Enchantress in hand and don't fear Droll & Lock Bird, activate [Water Enchantress of the Temple](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Water_Enchantress_of_the_Temple) to add Rite of Aramesir.
* 1. Activate [Rite of Aramesir](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rite_of_Aramesir), summoning an [Adventure Token](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Adventurer_Token) and activating [Fateful Adventure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fateful_Adventure) from Deck. This locks you from activating the effects of any non-Special Summoned monster the entire turn, retroactively.
* 2. Activate [Fateful Adventure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fateful_Adventure) to add [Wandering Gryphon Rider](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wandering_Gryphon_Rider) from your deck to your hand, then send 1 card from your hand to your GY. If you already have [Wandering Gryphon Rider](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wandering_Gryphon_Rider) in hand, you may add [Water Enchantress of the Temple](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Water_Enchantress_of_the_Temple) or [Illegal Knight](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Illegal_Knight).
* 3. Special Summon [Wandering Gryphon Rider](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wandering_Gryphon_Rider) by its own effect, triggering [Fateful Adventure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fateful_Adventure) to let you add [Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dracoback,_the_Rideable_Dragon) from Deck to hand.
* 4. Equip [Adventure Token](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Adventurer_Token) with [Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dracoback,_the_Rideable_Dragon).

Fully realized, it leaves you with:
* [Fateful Adventure](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Fateful_Adventure) face-up, which lets you add a monster that mentions Adventure Token every your turn, at the price of sending a card from hand to GY afterwards;
* [Adventure Token](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Adventurer_Token) that will survive its first possible destruction by battle, courtesy of Fateful Adventure
* * Adventure Token will be Equipped with [Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Dracoback,_the_Rideable_Dragon), which allows you to target and bounce any card your opponent controls on your turn, while being able to re-equip itself to Adventure Token if send to GY once per turn
* [Wandering Gryphon Rider](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Wandering_Gryphon_Rider), a level 8 WIND Winged Beast with 2000/2800 that, when you control Adventure Token, can Quick Effect omni negate and destroy by shuffling itself into the Deck - allowing it to be recycled with Fateful Adventure
* [Illegal Knight](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Illegal_Knight) is run by some, which Quick Effect Special Summons itself when you control no monsters or an Adventure Token and can Quick Effect target 1 or 2 cards the opponent controls, give control of itself to the opponent, and return the targeted cards to hand. It's a decent card going second or even first, but isn't as necessary as other parts.

In summary, you get a self-sustaining package that includes a free bounce and an omni negate. Many decks can also use the Adventure Token and/or Wandering Gryphon Rider as Link or Synchro Material as well.

Stop this package by stopping [Rite of Aramesir](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Rite_of_Aramesir) if you can, though it's difficult going second, as it does not add from deck to hand, doding Ash Blossom. Alternatively, stop [Water Enchantress of the Temple](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Water_Enchantress_of_the_Temple) if they play that first, otherwise stop Fateful Adventure itself when it attempts to add.

**Engine Skeleton:**
* 2-3 Rite of Aramesir
* 2-3 Water Enchantress of the Temple
* 1-2 Fateful Adventure
* 1 Dracoback, the Rideable Dragon
* 1 Wandering Gryphon Rider
* 0-1 Illegal Knight

*Whole engine is about $150 with 3 Rite/3 Water Enchantress/2 Fateful Adventure. If you cut 1 of each of these and accept the consistency loss (and also a 2nd Fateful Adventure isn't really necessary), it's about $100.*

## [P.U.N.K.](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/P.U.N.K.)

This versatile engine starts with [Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Ze_Amin), either Normal Summoning it (possibly having been added to hand via [Noh-P.U.N.K. Ogre Dance](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Ogre_Dance) or Special Summoning it (via [Emergency Teleport](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Emergency_Teleport)) and using its effect to add [Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Foxy_Tune).

Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune then sends itself from hand to GY as cost, and on resolution sends another card from hand to GY and Special Summons a P.U.N.K. from deck, generally [Noh-P.U.N.K. Deer Note](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Deer_Note), which when sent from the field to GY, can target then Special Summon a non-Level 5 P.U.N.K. from GY.

At this point, the functionality of the P.U.N.K. engine diverges with the strategy of the deck it's in - level 8 Synchros, link-2 Links, maybe more. Some common strategies:
* Make [Chaos Ruler, the Chaotic Magical Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Chaos_Ruler,_the_Chaotic_Magical_Dragon), so that the deck in question can excavate their deck's top 5 cards for a monster to add to hand and get potential benefits from sending the other excavated cards to the GY, and potentially use Chaos Ruler itself as synchro/link material both after initial summon and after its self-summon from GY. 
* Make [Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K. Amazing Dragon](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Ukiyoe-P.U.N.K._Amazing_Dragon) for its level 3 Psychic add from deck (useful in Virtual World to add Lulu). In addition, if Ze Amin is sent to GY and a P.U.N.K. is on the field when his effect activates, he can target that P.U.N.K. and boost its ATK, allowing him to further Chain Block along with Deer Note.
* Make [Crystron Halqifibrax](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Crystron_Halqifibrax) for any variety of combos using that card, either immediately with Ze Amin + Deer Note or with a Deer Note-summoned Ze Amin + what you make beforehand with Ze Amin + Deer Note.
* And who knows how many more.

Stop this package by stopping Ze Amin or Foxy Tune. Hitting Ze Amin may possibly waste your interaction, as your opponent may have drawn Foxy Tune. Hitting Foxy Tune will almost always work. Don't hit Emergency Teleport, as you can just hit Ze Amin or Foxy Tune later, and your opponent may have also drawn a Ze Amin/Ogre Dance.

**Engine Skeleton:**
* 1-3 [Noh-P.U.N.K. Ze Amin](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Ze_Amin)
* 0-3 [Noh-P.U.N.K. Ogre Dance](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Ogre_Dance)
* 1-2 [Noh-P.U.N.K. Foxy Tune](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Foxy_Tune) (is potentially a Garnet)
* 1-2 [Noh-P.U.N.K. Deer Note](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Noh-P.U.N.K._Deer_Note) (is a Garnet)
* 3 [Emergency Teleport](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Emergency_Teleport)
* Relevant Extra Deck monsters according to the deck/strategy

*Whole engine is about $65 with 2 Deer Note 2 Foxy Tune. Cutting one of one or both saves deck space but increases the risk of drawing a 1-of Garnet. Cutting one of each will save you about $27 for a new total of $38.*

## [Danger](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!)

On and off the Forbidden & Limited List, these monsters that cause random discards and then either gain effects of being discarded or summon themselves and draw a card when not discarded are used in a variety of decks to put bodies on the field, get cards from the hand to GY, and dig deeper into the deck.

**Engine Skeleton:**
* 3 [Danger! Nessie!](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!_Nessie!)
* * If discarded, it adds a Danger! card from deck to hand, letting you continue to dig through your deck/put bodies on the field while also thinning out the deck.
* 1 [Danger!? Jackalope?](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!%3F_Jackalope%3F)
* * If discarded, it summons another Danger from deck, ensuring you get a body on the field.
* 1 [Danger!? Tsuchinoko?](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!%3F_Tsuchinoko%3F)
* * If discarded, it summons itself, ensuring you get a body on the field.
* 0-3 [Danger! Bigfoot!](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!_Bigfoot!)
* * If discarded, can destroy an opponent's face-up card, helping keep abreast in card advantage and giving the engine a going-second functionality. 
* 0-3 [Danger! Mothman!](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!_Mothman!)
* * If discarded, each player draws 1 card and discards 1 card, ensuring you keep digging through your deck and letting you get a card from hand to GY, possibly triggering GY effects/other Dangers. Can also mess up your opponent's hand, or fix it/give them the same GY effects benefits, so beware. 
* 0-3 [Danger! Thunderbird!](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Danger!_Thunderbird!)
* * If discarded, can destroy an opponent's Set card, helping keep abreast in card advantage and giving the engine a going-second functionality. 

*The minimum package of 3 Nessie/1 Jackalope/1 Tsuchinoko will run you about $45, with ~$20 of that being Tsuchinoko. Expensive, but worth it. Mothman is $6 each, adding $18 to $45 for $63. Bigfoot is preferable to Thunderbird right now and is $6 each. Thunderbird is $2.50 each. Getting 3 Nessie/1 Jackalope/1 Tsuchinoko/3 Bigfoot/3 Mothman/3 Thunderbird totals to $90, but you'll have every mix of the best Dangers for the future.*

## [Tearlaments](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Tearlaments)
`TODO`

## [Spright](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Spright)
`TODO`

## Artifact

More of a package than an engine, a deck may make the incredibly generic [Artifact Dagda](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Artifact_Dagda) and trigger it to set [Artifact Scythe](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Artifact_Scythe). On the opponent's turn, some method is used to destroy the Set Artifact Scythe and special summon it to lock the opponent out of their Extra Deck, such as [Destiny HERO - Destroyer Phoenix Enforcer](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Destiny_HERO_-_Destroyer_Phoenix_Enforcer) or [T.G. Wonder Magician](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/T.G._Wonder_Magician)'s on-Synchro Summon effect using Crystron Halqifibrax to summon it. Most often now that Verte Anaconda is banned, it's Crystron Halqifibrax summoning T.G. Wonder Magician to do this, then using T.G. Wonder Magician's Synchro Summoning effect to tune with Artifact Scythe to make [Baronne de Fleur](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Baronne_de_Fleur), an incredibly powerful level 10 3k ATK Synchro with an omni negate and destroy, a free target and destroy on controller's turn, and a free Standby Phase Special Summon of a level 9 or lower monster from GY at the cost of returning itself to the Extra Deck from the field.

Note: Many players suspect Artifact Scythe is due for a ban soon.

When you have a method to reliably destroy the set Artifact Scythe, its an extremely generic and powerful package that requires just 1 Extra Deck slot and 1 Main Deck slot.

**Package Skeleton:**
* 1 [Artifact Dagda](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Artifact_Dagda)
* 1 [Artifact Scythe](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Artifact_Scythe)

*Scythe is available as a common for pennies and Dagda is $7.*

# Glossary

`Metagame`, or the game of the game, describes the current state of the game in terms of how good (consistent, powerful, grindy, etc) different decks, cards, and strategies are. This knowledge can then aid in making decisions on what decks/cards/strategies to run on your part and what to expect from opponents at competitive events. To call something `meta` is to say it is currently good.
